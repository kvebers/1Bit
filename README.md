# 1Bit
 
### This is going to be the game for the 1Bit challange

#### For the color scheme idea right now is to use shaders and [Unity Post Processing Volume 2.0](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.postprocessing@3.3/manual/index.html)

# Idea

### The Idea of the game is built around echo location, where the character can only see what is happening around when the sound waves are displayed.

### Diffrent levels of equipment dispaly diffrent leves of sound waves for example gun would fill the room full of sound waves meanwhile a step would create a small amount of sound waves.

### The game will have only 2 color schemes black and white.

## Todo list

## Make sound 1 Bit

We are playing sounds from the states of the whispering and when ever you use echo sound effect you can hear the scream from your soul.

## Map

We added 4 maps
Tutorial:


Level 1:


Level 2:


Level 3:

## Enemy

FOr the Enemy we added 10 diffrent types of statues for the spooky feels.

## Shaders and Post Processing Volume

For the shaders we are using shader graph dittering effect

## Add Win Condition

To win you need to go trough the portal

## Title Screen (Authors, Settings, Tutorial and START)

We made 3 sceens, about end and start with a cople of buttons.

## Make Echo Location
