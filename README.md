# 1Bit
 
This is going to be the game for the 1Bit challange

For the color scheme idea right now is to use shaders and [Unity Post Processing Volume 2.0](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.postprocessing@3.3/manual/index.html)

# Idea

The Idea of the game is built around echo location, where the character can only see what is happening around when the sound waves are displayed.

Diffrent levels of equipment dispaly diffrent leves of sound waves for example gun would fill the room full of sound waves meanwhile a step would create a small amount of sound waves.

The game will have only 2 color schemes black and white.

## Todo list

## Make sound 1 Bit
## Map
## Enemy
## Shaders and Post Processing Volume
## Add Gun and other weapons
## Add Win Condition
## Add light effect for the eyes for the enemy
## Title Screen (Authors, Settings, Tutorial and START)
## Buttons to press inside of the Tutorial or Info
## Make sphere for the expansion of the sound across the map
### We make 2 speheres 1 sphere of light and 1 transperent sphere and let it naturaly bounce
### We make a white partialy transperent spehere and let it highlight the region, add luminosity on top of the spehere
## Document all the steps
