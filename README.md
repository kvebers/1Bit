# Idea

The Idea of the game is built around echo location, where the character can only see what is happening around when the sound waves are displayed.

Diffrent levels of equipment dispaly diffrent leves of sound waves for example gun would fill the room full of sound waves meanwhile a step would create a small amount of sound waves.

The game will have only 2 color schemes black and white.
